    <p>
        <b>GitHub, Inc.</b> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service">Internet hosting
            service</a> for software development and version control using
        Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature
        requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California,
        it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

        It is commonly used to host <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> software
        development projects. As of January 2023, GitHub reported
        having over 100 million developers and more than 372 million repositories, including at least 28 million
        public repositories. It is the largest source code host as of November 2021.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>GitHub.com</h3>
    <p>
        Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April
        2008 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, Chris Wanstrath, P.
        J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a
        few months prior as a beta release. GitHub has an annual keynote called GitHub Universe.
    </p>
    <h3>Organizational structure</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub, Inc. was originally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization">flat organization</a>
        with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager"
        (self-management). Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but
        salaries were set by the chief executive.

            commits
            (right) per country.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </p>
    <h3>Finance</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub.com was a bootstrapped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company">start-up business</a>,
        which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded
        solely by its three founders and start taking on employees. In July 2012, four years after the company was
        founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">venture capital</a>. In July 2015 GitHub raised another
        $250 million of venture capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive
        Capital, and other venture capital funds.

        In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories. A year later, this number doubled. <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReadWrite">ReadWriteWeb</a>
        reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of
        January to May 2011. On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more
        than 5 million repositories. By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching
        10 million repositories.
    </p>
    <h3>Acquisition by Microsoft</h3>
    <p>
        On June 4, 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> announced its intent to acquire
        GitHub for US$7.5 billion. The deal closed on October
        26, 2018. GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business. Under
        Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president
        of Microsoft Cloud and AI. GitHub's CEO, Chris Wanstrath, was retained as a "technical fellow," also reporting
        to Guthrie. Nat Friedman resigned November 3, 2021; he was replaced by Thomas Dohmke.

            in 2016</figcaption>
    </figure>
    There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at
    Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions,
    such as Nokia's mobile business and Skype.
    This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger
    focus on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source
    software. Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access
    to its user base, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage the use of its other development products and
    services.

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>Projects on GitHub.com can be accessed and managed using the standard <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> command-line interface; all standard
        Git commands work with it. GitHub.com also allows users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple
        desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. The site provides social networking-like functions such as
        feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called Gollum) and a social network graph to display how developers
        work on their versions ("forks") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

        Anyone can browse and download public repositories but only registered users can contribute content to
        repositories. With a registered user account, users are able to have discussions, manage repositories, submit
        contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code. GitHub.com began offering limited private
        repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public
        repositories were free. On April 14, 2020, GitHub made "all of the core GitHub features" free for
        everyone, including "private repositories with unlimited collaborators."
    </p>
    <h3>GitHub Enterprise</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub Enterprise is a self-managed version of GitHub.com with similar functionality. It can be run on an
        organization's own hardware or on a cloud provider, and it has been available since November 2011. In
        November 2020, source code for GitHub Enterprise Server was leaked online in an apparent protest against DMCA
        takedown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>. According to GitHub, the source
        code came from GitHub accidentally sharing the code with
        Enterprise customers themselves, not from an attack on GitHub servers.
    </p>
    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>
        Since 2008, GitHub has offered GitHub Pages, a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static</a> web hosting service for blogs, project
        documentation, and books.

        All GitHub Pages content is stored in a Git repository, either as files served to visitors verbatim or in
        Markdown format. GitHub is integrated with Jekyll static website and blog generator and GitHub continuous
        integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically
        serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure.

        As with the rest of GitHub, it includes both free and paid tiers of service. Websites generated through this
        service are hosted either as subdomains of the github.io domain, or can be connected to custom domains bought
        through a third-party domain name registrar. GitHub Pages supports HTTPS encryption.
    </p>
    <h3>Education program</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students over the age of 13 free
        access to popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnami">Bitnami</a>, Crowdflower, DigitalOcean,
        DNSimple, HackHands, Namecheap, Orchestrate, Screenhero, SendGrid, Stripe, Travis CI, and Unreal Engine to
        launch the program.

        In 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program to train and encourage students to
        grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18
        years and older across the world. GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds
        student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional
        resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert applicants must complete an online
        training course consisting of multiple modules designed to grow community leadership skills.
